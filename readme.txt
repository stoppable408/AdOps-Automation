Steps to running the program. 

1. Get current Placement Info sheet from Kristine, if possible, you can ask Holly for Access to the Google Drive and be able to get the current placement info sheet yourself, 
because Kristine may forget to send it to you. 

2. Place the Placement Info sheet into the folder, and make sure it's named "placement_info" and that it's an .xlsx file. if this requirement is not met, you'll get a "File Not Found Error"

3. Run the program. 

4. Monitor Program's process occasionally. Sometimes the program will hang up, if it does. Just press CTRL + C, only once though. if you press it too many times, it will cause the program to exit completely

5. Once the program is done running, Find all of the files in the folder and email them to Kristine. 

6. She may ask you to run specific reports alone again, if you want to challenge yourself you can edit the code on line 48 and 49 to only run a report for that specific site.
